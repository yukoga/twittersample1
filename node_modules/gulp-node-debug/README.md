# gulp-node-debug

A wrapper around [node-inspector](https://github.com/node-inspector/node-inspector) for gulp, has the same functionality as the **node-debug** command.

Perfect for development. Easy to use.

1. Runs node-inspector.
2. Runs the supplied script in debug mode
3. Opens the user's browser, pointing it at the inspector.

## Installation

`npm install gulp-node-debug --save-dev`

## Usage

This is the minimal setup. The file `app.js` will be debugged with default values.

```javascript
// gulpfile.js
var gulp = require('gulp');
var nodeDebug = require('gulp-node-debug');
gulp.task('debug', function() {

    gulp.src(['app.js'])
        .pipe(nodeDebug());
});
```

Add `debugBrk: true` if your script finishes immediately:

```javascript
// gulpfile.js
var gulp = require('gulp');
var nodeDebug = require('gulp-node-debug');
gulp.task('debug', function() {

    gulp.src(['app.js'])
        .pipe(nodeDebug({
            debugBrk: true
        }));
});
```

This example shows all available options (default values):

```javascript
// gulpfile.js
var gulp = require('gulp');
var nodeDebug = require('gulp-node-debug');
gulp.task('debug', function() {

    gulp.src(['app.js'])
        .pipe(nodeDebug({
            debugPort: 5858,
            webHost: '0.0.0.0',
            webPort: 8080,
            debugBrk: false,
            nodejs: [],
            script: [],
            saveLiveEdit: false,
            preload: true,
            inject: true,
            hidden: [],
            stackTraceLimit: 50,
            sslKey: '',
            sslCert: ''
        }));
});
```

Enter `gulp debug` in your shell to start the node-inspector, run the supplied script and to open the debug URL in Chrome, Chromium or Opera.

## Options

All options are written in camelCase style:

| Option              | Default   | Description |
| :------------------ | :-------: | :-------- |
| debugPort           | 5858      | Node/V8 debugger port.
| webHost             | '0.0.0.0' | Host to listen on for Node Inspector's web interface. `node-debug` listens on `127.0.0.1` by default.
| webPort             | 8080      | Port to listen on for Node Inspector's web interface.
| **node-debug**
| debugBrk            | true      | Break on the first line.
| nodejs              | []        | List of string to pass NodeJS options to debugged process.
| script              | []        | List of string to pass options to debugged process.
| **node-inspector**
| saveLiveEdit        | false     | Save live edit changes to disk (update the edited files).
| preload             | true      | Preload *.js files. You can disable this option<br/>to speed up the startup.
| inject              | true      | Enable injection of debugger extensions into the debugged process.
| hidden              | []        | Array of files to hide from the UI, breakpoints in these files will be ignored. All paths are interpreted as regular expressions.
| stackTraceLimit     | 50        | Number of stack frames to show on a breakpoint.
| sslKey              | ''        | Path to file containing a valid SSL key.
| sslCert             | ''        | Path to file containing a valid SSL certificate.


## Credits

This project was forked from [gulp-node-inspector](https://github.com/koemei/gulp-node-inspector) which wraps **node-inspector** (but does not start a debugged process). All real work was done by [node-inspector](https://github.com/node-inspector/node-inspector).
